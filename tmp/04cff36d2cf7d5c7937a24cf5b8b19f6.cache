<p>The petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried under sediment or volcanic ash. Rapid burial is vital to ensure the tree trunks is buried without insects or oxygen &ndash; the necessary ingredient for decay, and preserves the original plant structure and general appearance.</p>
<p>The mineralization process occurs when mineralrich water flows through the mass of material. In this prehistoric brew, the water deposits minerals in the plant&rsquo;s cells, replacing the organic plant structure with inorganic minerals, mostly a silicate-like quartz. As the plant&rsquo;s cellulose or living matter decays, a stone cast is formed in its place. The final result, which can take up to 300 million years to form, is petrified wood, something that resembles a plant with its original structure in place, now replaced by stone.</p>',

<h3>MINERAL DEPOSITS</h3>
<p>Elements such as manganese, iron, and copper in the water/mud during the petrification process give petrified wood a variety of color ranges. Pure quartz crystals are colorless, but when contaminants are added to the process the crystals take on a yellow, red, or other tints.</p>
<p>The Timeless Things Company is based in Indonesia, where petrified wood dates from the Cenozo&iuml;cum era, about 20-22 million years ago. Surrounded by the Ring of Fire, this highly volcanic region produces petrified wood that is characterized by white, brown, grey and black colors.</p>
